            A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent,
             and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Good paragraphs begin with a topic sentence that briefly explains what the paragraph is about. 
            <hr>
            Next come a few sentences for development and support, elaborating on the topic with more detail. Paragraphs end with a conclusion sentence that summarizes the topic or presents one final piece of support to wrap up.
